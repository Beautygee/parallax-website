    <h2>Section One</h2>
    <p>Nature is the most beautiful and attractive surrounding around us which make us 
        happy and provide us natural environment to live healthy. Our nature provides us variety of beautiful flowers,
         attractive birds, animals, green plants, blue sky, land, running rivers, sea, forests, air, mountains, valleys,
          hills and many more things. Our God has created a beautiful 
        nature for the healthy living of us. All the things we use for our living are 
        the assets of nature which we should not spoil and damage.
        We should not destroy the originality of the nature and should not imbalance the ecosystem cycle.
         Our nature provides us beautiful environment to live and enjoy so it is our responsibility to keep it 
         clean and away from all the damages. In the modern era, many selfish and bad activities of the human being have 
         disturbed the nature to a great extent. But we all should try to maintain our natureâ€™s beauty.</p>

    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>Nature is the most precious and valuable gift to us from the God to live our life here on the earth. 
        Nature makes our life easy by providing all the required resources for daily living. We should thankful to our
         nature for helping, caring and nurturing us like a mother. We can enjoy the sweet sound and scenery of the 
         nature if we peacefully sit in the early morning in the garden. Our nature is adorned with lots of scenic beauty 
         which we can enjoy anytime. Earth has geographical beauty and known as the city of garden or heaven. But it is 
         sad to say that such beautiful gifts of God are declining day by day due to the technological advancement and 
         high level of ignorance of the human beings.

    <h2>Section Three</h2>
    <p>Everything in the nature has their own power and uniqueness provided by the God. It has its many forms which are 
        changing by season to season and even from minute to minute such as sea looks bright blue in the morning but by noon
         it looks emerald green colour. Sky changes its colour all through the day from pale pink at sunrise, dazzling blue in
          late morning, bright orange in evening at sunset and purple by twilight. Our mood also gets changed according to the
           nature such as happy and hopeful at sun shine, rainy season and spring season. We feel heartily happy at moonlight 
           sand little bored and tired in high sun light.
